Passion Repository

Passion is collection of libraries intended for game development with C++ and Lua. Currently, the following libraries are up and running:

- render: A render library with 2D and 3D grapics support.
- input: A input library, also used to manage the render window.
- network: A networking library with socket objects.

Passion will build without issues on Microsoft Visual C++ 2008. In theory the libraries are completely cross-platform, but some libraries won't work right on Linux.
