Passion Repository

Passion is collection of libraries intended for game development with C++ and Lua. Additionally this repository includes the Passion game engine, which allows people to make 3D games with Lua. Currently, the following libraries are available:

- render: A render library with 2D and 3D grapics support.
- input: A input library, also used to manage the render window.
- network: A networking library with socket objects.
- scripting: A scripting library which makes interaction with Lua scripts easy.

Passion will build without issues on Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 and 2010. In theory the libraries are completely cross-platform, but some libraries won't work right on Linux currently.
